            <p>
                Hi, I'm teacher Maria. I was born in Guatemala and moved to NYC as a child at the age of 2. 
                This has given me the ability to <span>speak both English and Spanish fluently</span>. For the last <span>10 years</span>, 
                I had the privilege of working for the <span>biggest school district in the United States of America</span>.
            </p>
            <p>
                Living and working in NYC has given me the opportunity to work with a diverse group of <span>students
                from all over the world</span>. Many of them just like you are English Language Learners. 
            </p>
            <p>
                As an immigrant, <span>I strongly believe that a child’s home language is an integral cultural asset
                 that should be honored</span>, sustained and reflected in our program. Students in my school will learn
                  English but we must remember that the home language enriches learning and supports English 
                  language acquisition. 
            </p>

            <h4>Give Them Head Start</h4>
            <p>Children who learn another language before age five use the same part of the brain to acquire that second
               language that they use to learn their mother tongue. 
            </p>
            <h4>Feed Their Brains!</h4>
            <p>Research shows that learning a second language boosts problem-solving, critical-thinking, and listening skills,
               in addition to improving memory, concentration, and the ability to multitask. Children proficient in other languages
               also show signs of enhanced creativity and mental flexibility. 
            </p>
            <h4>Start Early, Stay Long!</h4>
            <p>The length of time a student is able to devote to learning a language has a direct and positive correlation to cognitive
                development. Longer sequences also provide the opportunity for learners to grow alongside the additional language and culture,
                developing a deeper connection as they mature. 
            </p>
            <h4>Don’t Hesitate: Go for Two… or Three!</h4>
            <p>Contrary to popular belief, young children are not confused by the introduction of multiple languages at the same time. Not only 
               do they naturally navigate multilingual environments, but acquiring a second language early in life primes the brain to learn multiple
               other languages, opening a world of opportunities for later on.
